## AWS dynamodb to Metabase

It is surprisingly hard to get data from aws dynamodb to metabase.

Connect aws athena to metabase.
Why Athena?
Athena lets us query data in S3 using standard SQL

Get data to S3 from dynamodb
- create a bucket in s3
- feedback-orders

AWS Glue
- serverless data integration service
- ETL (extract, transform, and load) service
- need to use glue to change it from json to parquet file
- https://parquet.apache.org/
- build crawler
- crawler runs on JSON database in S3, exported from dynamodb





- create bucket in s3.
- export from s3 to a bucket (JSON)
- create empty s3 bucket for parquet file 
- add data to bucket?


- feedback-orders -> s3 table exported from dynamodb (JSON content)
- feedback-orders-parquet -> s3 table exported from dynamodb (parquet content)
